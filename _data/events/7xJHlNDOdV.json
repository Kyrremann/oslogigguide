  "description": "Ulrika Spacek kommer endelig til Oslo for første gang lørdag 24. oktober!\n\nAktuelle med sitt 4. album EXPO, er de i toppform, og klare for å innta Revolver med sin særegne psych/kraut rock lyd.\n\n\"If all the world is a stage, then our performance is a lonely one. Reflected not through eyes but through screens ad infinitum, our audience – real or imagined – is no longer a burden but a need. Attention, recognition, validation: we trade our interior worlds for the thrill of public display. In a hyper-individual world, Ulrika Spacek’s fourth album EXPO offers an antidote.\n\nEven as its five members have been pulled by tides of their own, Ulrika Spacek has always been a symbol of collective art. Despite a range of day jobs (experimental physicists, graphic designers, music producers) the collective pursuit is there in the shared dream logic of the music: the off-kilter melodies, jagged guitars and cirrus cloud atmospherics. It’s there, in all the things that are said and unsaid between them; there in the writing, producing and mixing processes they share in. And even as each of their parts moves toward a unified vision, it’s never more keenly felt than in the bigger picture to which Ulrika Spacek belong.\"",
