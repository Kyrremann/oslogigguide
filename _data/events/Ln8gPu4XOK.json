  "description": "Rome Is Not A Town from Gothenburg (Sweden) debuted in 2015 with the single Stupid and has since released several EPs and the debut album It’ s a Dare (2017) which established them as one of the most distinctive voices in Swedish indie rock.\n\nLive, their music explodes and pulls the audience in from the very first note. With a powerful, magnetic energy, the band takes over the room and refuses to let go. The new album Echoes of Love (2026) marks a clear and confident step forward. Still familiarly intense and uncompromising, but with a new sharpness and greater seriousness.",
