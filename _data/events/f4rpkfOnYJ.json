  "description": "**Den amerikanske singer-songwriteren Shawn James kommer til John Dee lørdag 28. februar med fullt band! Vi lar ham presentere seg selv:**\n\nHey there, this is Shawn James.\n\nI’ve had way too many writers think they could sum me up & relay what I’m about from an hour long conversation so they could write my “bio” but I’ve had it. Screw that. I’ll tell it in my own words.\n\nI was born & raised In Chicago, Illinois. I grew up on the south side of the city where I attended a gospel church. I was always around a lot of heartfelt soulful music & hardworking, real, down to earth people. Although I no longer abide by any religion, I value the times I had and how they shaped me to be what I am now.\n\nI’ve moved around quite a bit living in all different parts of the US. While absorbing all sorts of different cultures from here & around the world, I’ve developed my own sound.\n\nI started releasing my own music in 2012 and haven’t stopped since. I play a wide range of music from folk to blues, r&b, Gospel to rock, metal & alotta things in between. The main constant amongst all the genres would be that it’s all done with emotion, feeling, heart & a lotta soul. I mean what I say & deeply feel what I play.\n\nI play covers of songs I dig sometimes and although some people may only know me because of those, I’m hardly just a cover artist.\n\nIf you come see me play live and expect just one style or aspect of what I do, you may be disappointed to learn that our shows are a roller coaster of emotions, musical styles, intensity & energy. I get bored easily & love to mix things up. Be ready & bring your ear plugs just in case..\n\nI’ve always been the underdog so to speak since I’ve never had the backing of a large record label, big marketing firm or massive PR company & I truly like it that way. I feel as though I’ve earned what I have through hard work, determination, a good bit of luck & the great relationships with people I’ve made along the way. I’ve learned a lot of lessons the hard way being in this “music business industry” and that’s alright by me. I’ve seen that with your support (the listeners out there) I can make my wildest dreams come true.\n\nIf you want to listen to an artist that’s authentic, genuine & original then you’ve come to the right place.\n\nI hope you enjoy the music & will join me on this journey that I’m so extremely grateful to be on. Thank you all so very much.\n\n**Love,\nShawn James**\n\n--\n\nBill. kr. 315,- + bill.avg.\n\n18 års aldersgrense med legitimasjonsplikt. Ingen vergeordning.
