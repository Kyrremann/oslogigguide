  "description": "ORGIVM PRESENTS - Tomarum Dark Art Exhibition opening with GRYLA\n\nIn January, it's yet again time for the best possible start of the festival season when ORGIVM V makes the winter season even darker for the fifth time. But two days is not enough, so this time we bring you more darkness at Brewgata with a special art exhibition by the amazing TomaRum and a concert by Oslo's black metal underground band Gryla!\n\nWe are immensely proud to present the first exhibition in Norway by Sweden's dark artist/designer/photographer Tomarum by Christine Linde since 2019. Her hauntingly sinister and beautiful pictures have been showcased at festivals like Inferno, Copenhell and Midgardsblot, as well as on album covers by Afsky, Ereb Altor and others. In addition to having a selection of her pictures on display at Brewgata, you will also be able to buy signed prints from the artist.\n\nTo make the opening night of the exhibition even darker, the fierce black metal beast GRYLA from Oslo will deliver a solid dose of mayhemic noise that brings the tradition of bands like Kvist, Dødheimsgard and Gorgoroth into the new age with precision and brutality, adding their own unique touch to the genre.\n\nFree admission for everyone with a festival pass, 50,- for everybody else at the door.\n--\nORGIVM V\nhttps://www.orgivm.no/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/orgivmsatanicvm",
