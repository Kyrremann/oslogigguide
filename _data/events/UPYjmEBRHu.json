  "description": "Emerging in 2025 from Liverpool, United Kingdom, newhvn blends rock, alternative rock and grunge into a genre-defying sound. From the remains of a post-rock instrumental band, the project newhvn has surfaced, blending together their post-rock roots with their shoe-gaze and post-hardcore influences.\n\nHaving toured the world and released two albums as their former project A Burial at Sea, newhvn have had years of experience on the road, building fanbases up around Ireland, UK, Europe and Asia and have supported bands such as And So I Watch You From Afar, The Ocean, This Will Destroy You. They’ve also made appearances at festivals like ArcTanGent (UK), Post in Paris (FR), Bergmal (SW), and Dunk (BE). \n\nWanting to break away from their post-rock sound, the remains of A Burial at Sea took themselves to Black Bay Studios on the Isle of Lewis, Scotland and newhvn was born. Pulling influences from Pinegrove and Cloakroom and combined it with their post-rock background a collection of 10 songs were formed, to be released in 2026.",
