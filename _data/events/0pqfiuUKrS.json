  "description": "Rekordåren’s music is a nod to another Sweden - Swedish indie that effortlessly blends folk, blues, and gritty prog. A live act that, for a moment, helps you forget that you’re in a Sweden where records are more often set in crises than in progress.\n\nIn 2025, the band released several critically acclaimed singles and played to sold-out venues in Gothenburg, Stockholm, and on tour throughout southern Sweden. GAFFA has described Rekordåren as “one of the most interesting bands on the Swedish indie scene right now.”\n\nThe debut album, scheduled for release in autumn 2026, will show why Rekordåren already belongs on the Swedish indie scene.",
