In 2011 they released a first full-length studio album Our Zoo followed in 2013 by a second self-\nreleased album Shiva Telescopes. After a little break the band returned in 2016 with a digital EP The Smell Of Space, and with a renewed line-up they released Child In The Woods EP in 2018 and a third album The Goddess Of\nSunrise in 2020. In 2025 new album - Cast in Stone\nFlynotes played a lot of shows including tours in Europe and Japan. \n\nWhat the trio brings is an instrumental mixture of different yet closely related styles and sub-genres such as Doom Metal, Stoner, Psychedelic Rock, Post-Rock and Progressive. Guitar-based sound done by extremely heavy electric guitar riffs and monumental leads. The melodies are supported by a truly fantastic rhythm section which includes hypnotic bass lines and monumental drum patterns.\nDører: 20:00\nKonsertstart: 20:30\nInngang: 285.-\nID: 20\n\nLinks:\nhttps://flynotes.bandcamp.com\nhttps://www.facebook.com/flynotes\nhttps://instagram.com/flynotesband",
