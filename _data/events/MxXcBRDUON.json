  "description": "Sev Dah\n\nTechno-proletarian and antifascist.\nBerlin, Detroit, Birmingham and, of course, Sarajevo.\nBosnian-built and -bred Sev Dah may be a Swedish expat, but the Balkan blackness clings strongly to the bleak percussions and rigidly uneasy synthetics that unwillingly fuse into his strongly individual take on techno. Authentically purveying the pulsations of the nakedly throbbing and ugly world, far away from Starbucks and H&M.\n\nBellicose x IdaM\n\nCutting his teeth in the grungy clubs of Sarajevo, Amar is joined by Ida, a seasoned presence in Oslo’s underground. Expect groovy, syncopated rhythms, droney textures, dense stabs, and tactile kickdrums, layered with precision and held close to the harder edges. Together, they move with intent, building and releasing pressure while keeping the floor locked in motion.\n\n—\n\nID: 20\nCC: 150\n\n",
