  "description": "Enda en ekte UK legende på Hærverk!\n\nMark Broom\n\nA truly prolific artist, Mark Broom has a myriad of production credits to his name having worked with world renowned labels such as Blueprint Records, Rekids, M-plant, EPM, Cocoon, Bpitch Control, Warp Records and the legendary Ifach with Baby Ford.\n\nIt all started in the summer of ‘89 when he landed in Tenerife on vacation and stumbled across the delights of the emerging sounds of Chicago and Acid House. Returning to the UK, he immediately went in search of this new found music, a pair of turntables were bought and with it a musical career was born. He has also had the pleasure of reworking material from artists such as Robert Hood, Floorplan, Alan Fitzpatrick and Gary Beck.\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/beardman\nhttps://www.instagram.com/markbroom\nhttps://www.discogs.com/artist/459-Mark-Broom\n\n--\n\nAnnette K varmer opp gølvet!\n\nID: 20\nCC: 200,-\n\n",
