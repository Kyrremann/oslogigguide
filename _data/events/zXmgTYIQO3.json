  "description": "Purple Skies is an underground rock band from Bergen, Norway, formed in 2017. With roots in\nthe heavy rock of the late ’60s and ’70s and a dark veil of doom, Purple Skies delivers drenched,  fuzz driven rock that moves seamlessly between crushing riƯs and classic melodies. Their music draws inspiration from stoner rock, proto-doom, and vintage heavy rock.\nThe band now presents their debut album, A Million Years. Henrik Solheim (guitar) and Marius\nAasen Moe (guitar and vocals) founded the band in a cold basement on Askøy, originally aiming to play pure doom, but the sound evolved into something wider and more dynamic.\nAfter years of lineup changes and musical refinement, the long awaited album has finally come\nto life. The band truly came together when Robert Johansen and Jøran Mjelde joined, completing\nthe lineup and turning the long vision of an album into reality. The result reflects years of\nevolution and craftsmanship, yet the heavy, doom roots remain a red thread running through A\nMillion Years.",
