  "description": "Merry Yule dudes and dudettes!\nTwo years ago Draven & Lie were asked if we'd like to do a little pre-Christmas gig at Brewgata, and being our favorite place to play we of course jumped at the chance. And we had so much fun we decided to do it again this year! 😃\n\nLike last time we've dug up some tunes that we haven't played in a while, coupled them with a few staples, and...since 'tis the season to be jolly, etc. we'll be throwing in a couple of kinda Christmas songs this year as well! 🎄\n\nSo come join us in kicking off the Christmas weekend!\nHo ho ho, and a bottle of Jack! 🎅🥃",
