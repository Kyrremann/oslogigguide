  "description": "Øyvind Morken has a unique ability to play everything from A to Z of what genres concern. Working the dance floor in the most unexpected ways. Drawing in a crowd of open-minded party freaks for nights of wild abandon, and where musical diversity and self-expression is encouraged. Gigs has appeared in clubs all over Europe, from Berghain to Bassiani, Phonox, Lux and Razzmatazz to festivals like Dekmantel Selectors, Kala and Dimensions. And there are productions taking up catalog space on such diverse labels as Moonlighting, Full Pupp, Mysticisms, Snick Snack and Gravity Graffiti. There was also Road Trippin, a cassette mixtape on the esteemed imprint L.I.E.S. Records.\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/oyvind-morken\n\n--\n\nID: 20\nGratis inngang\n\n",
